    <h5>ABOUT MY PHOTO CARD</h5>
    <p>
      My Photo Card is my Demo Day project for the completion of my web development program at The Iron Yard â€¢ Tampa-St. Pete.
    </p>
    <h3>The Genesis of My Photo Card</h3>
    <p>
      When it came time to decide on a final project I wanted to do something fun. Being a sports fan, graphic designer and photographer I have always loved creating sports posters, magazine covers and trading cards for print. So, why not try to create a web app that would allow anyone to create their own trading card? Fun and challenging.
    </p>
    <h3>How it Evolved</h3>
    <p>
      My Photo Card started out as My Sports Card. After having a few friends test it out they suggested having designs for more than sports. Thus, My Photo Card.
