    <h5>ABOUT MY PHOTO CARD</h5>
    <p>
      Being a sports fan, graphic designer and photographer I have always loved creating sports posters, magazine covers and trading cards for print. So, why not try to create a web app that would allow anyone to create their own trading card? Fun and challenging.
