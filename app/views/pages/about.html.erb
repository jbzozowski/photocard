    <h5>ABOUT MY PHOTO CARD</h5>
    <p>
      My Photo Card is my Demo Day project for the completion of my web development program at The Iron Yard â€¢ Tampa-St. Pete.

    <h3>Backstory</h3>
    <p>
      Early on in my graphics career, about 25 years ago, I was given the opportunity to design a baseball card for a Philadelphia Phillies fan souvenir. Fans could visit a kiosk at the stadium, have a photo taken, printed, and placed between both sides of the card with the photo showing through and opening in the front. The technology was pretty limited back then but it was a big hit with the fans.
